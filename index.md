Today we created a website that will provide the details of all our team meetings, hold each team member's developer notes, and discusses the progress we have made with our project throughout the semester. We tested the Web Crawler and it was able to find articles relating to our keywords. Lastly, we tried out Page Optimizer Pro for the first time. Lonnie recommended that we take a look at Page Optimizer Pro because he believed it would help us understand how to improve the Google rankings of the Wordpress articles.

Our Wordpress plugin can find articles relevant to the keyword provided, copy the article and publish a copy of the article to the offline Wordpress site.

We met today and talked about what each person will be working on moving forward. Grace will be working on the database. She will use a Lamp server which should be compatible with our Web Scraper. In our database, we will save the articles that were used to generate the article so that when the web crawler is looking for articles, it will avoid articles that we have already discovered. Grace mentioned that she was having difficulty logging into her Mutilab account. However, she mentioned that she will find a way to get access to her account and start the process of creating a LAMP server. The LAMP server will hold the list of pages that we need to fetch and the list of pages that we have already fetched. This avoids the issue of
