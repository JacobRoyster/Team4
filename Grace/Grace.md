  For the semester, we will be creating a Blog Bot that copies articles relevant to a keyword and posts them to an online Wordpress site. We have been brainstorming and thinking of methods to implement this. 
  
  
  After meeting with Ryan, we realized that we cannot publish the article to the Wordpress site. Instead, we will send an email to Ryan after the Blog Bot generates the article. He will then proof read the article, chekcing for errors and after complete approval, post the article to the Wordpress site. 
  
  
  We met with both Ryan and Lonnie to discuss the implementation of the project and how to get a leg up on the project. Lonnie presented an application, Page Optimizer Pro, that will help us tremendously with our project. This application checks for the rankings of website on Google. He further suggested that it is beneficial to include minimal usage of the keyword in each article since excess use of a keyword willl hurt our Google rankings.
