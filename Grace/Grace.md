For the semester, we will be creating a Blog Bot that copies articles relevant to a keyword and posts them to an online Wordpress site. We have been brainstorming and thinking of methods to implement this. 
  
  
After meeting with Ryan, we realized that we cannot publish the article to the Wordpress site. Instead, we will send an email to Ryan after the Blog Bot generates the article. He will then proof read the article, checking for errors and after complete satisfaction, post the article to the Wordpress site. 
  
  
We met with both Ryan and Lonnie to discuss the implementation of the project and how to get a leg up on the project. Lonnie presented an application, Page Optimizer Pro, that will help us tremendously with our project. This application checks for the rankings of website on Google. He further suggested that it is beneficial to include minimal usage of the keyword in each article since excess use of a keyword will hurt our Google rankings. 
  
We met today and tested out Page Optimizer Pro to see how it will benefit us in the project.

Today we met with Ryan and Lonnie to update them on our progress with the project and what we would like to have finished by the end of the semester. Up until now, we are able to use the Web Crawler to find an article and the offline Wordpress plugin is able to copy the article and post a draft. We discussed that by the end of the semester, we would like the plugin to only copy important parts of the article rather than copying the entire article.
