Today we are to meet with Dr. Chartos, 
The past I have been mostly busy, but I have been doing work for another project that is closely related. 
The work I have done is building a parser that decomposes articles into an inverted index. This inverted index maps content
to documents. Thus if we want to know what document has the word "search", it is easy to see all the documents, locations in 
that document, and the count of the word in that document.
Dean said that he had a family emergency and thus hasn't able to make significant progress but has communicated with who is
actually hosting the website, and has gotten credentials that supposedly will allow us to install our plugin on the wordpress 
site. 
Grace said that she has been working on updating the website.
When we meet next, we are to lay out a plan on what we want to store so Grace can start working in depth on the database. 
Dean and I also need to discuss how we are going to make our selection for the article more intelligent. Thus Ryan will have to
do less editing. We are unclear exactly when we are able to meet, but likely will we be able to get more work done before the next
class meeting, and thus will have more to report. 
In order to better keep my thoughts organized, and so other can view my perspecitve on our progress of the project, I am going
to be more mindful in keeping notes. I will keep more notes with Class Meetings, and Team Meetings.
